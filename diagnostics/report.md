# SchoolConnect Deep Debug - Baseline Diagnostics Report

**Generated:** 2025-08-18T20:53:18+02:00

## Issues Identified

### 1. Redirect-to-Waiting-Page Bug
**Status:** Critical
**Description:** Users are being incorrectly redirected to waiting page regardless of approval status

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `PrivateRoute.tsx` (lines 54-58): Logic checks `approved === false` but may have issues with:
  - Null/undefined values not being handled properly
  - Race conditions during profile loading
  - Inconsistent approval status in database

### 2. Dashboard Flicker on Refresh
**Status:** High Priority
**Description:** Dashboard components flicker/re-render on page refresh

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `AuthContext.tsx`: Multiple state updates and redundant profile fetches
- Loading states not properly synchronized
- LocalStorage hydration causing race conditions
- Profile fetching happens multiple times (lines 127-139, 182-204)

### 3. React Error #310 in AI Generator
**Status:** High Priority
**Description:** Unhandled React error in AI bulletin generation

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- No specific error boundary for AI components
- Potential issues in `backendVerification.ts` AI integration (lines 131-166)
- Missing error handling in AI-related components

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Authentication Flow
```
Login → AuthContext.fetchUserProfile() → PrivateRoute → RoleRoute → Dashboard
```

**Issues Found:**
1. **Multiple Profile Fetches:** Profile is fetched in both `useEffect` and `onAuthStateChange`
2. **Race Conditions:** Loading state management is inconsistent
3. **Approval Logic:** `approved` field handling needs improvement

### Database Schema Issues
1. **RLS Policies:** Some tables have RLS enabled but may have conflicting policies
2. **Approval Field:** Recently added `approved` boolean may have null values
3. **Missing Indexes:** Performance issues in overview queries

### Frontend Issues
1. **Error Boundaries:** Only global error boundary exists
2. **Loading States:** Inconsistent loading state management
3. **State Management:** Multiple sources of truth for user state

## Suspected Root Causes (Ranked by Likelihood)

1. **High:** Approval status handling in `PrivateRoute` - null/undefined values
2. **High:** Race conditions in `AuthContext` profile fetching
3. **Medium:** RLS policy conflicts causing 401/403 errors
4. **Medium:** Missing error boundaries for AI components
5. **Low:** Database performance issues in overview queries

## Next Steps

1. Fix approval status logic and null handling
2. Optimize AuthContext to prevent race conditions
3. Add specific error boundaries for AI components
4. Review and fix RLS policies
5. Add comprehensive logging for debugging
