## üß™ Automated Testing

### Unit and Integration Testing
- Installed Jest, Testing Library, and related dependencies
- Created `jest.config.js` with proper configuration
- Added `src/setupTests.ts` for test environment setup
- Implemented test for `AuthContext` with user authentication flows
- Added test scripts to `package.json`:
  - `npm test` - Run all tests
  - `npm test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
  - `npm test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

### End-to-End Testing
- Installed Playwright for cross-browser testing
- Created `playwright.config.ts` configuration
- Added end-to-end tests for homepage navigation
- Added test scripts to `package.json`:
  - `npm e2e` - Run end-to-end tests
  - `npm e2e:ui` - Run end-to-end tests with UI

## üì¶ Development Workflow Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Improved error boundaries in `App.tsx` with detailed error display
- Added comprehensive error logging throughout the application
- Implemented timeout mechanisms for Supabase queries
- Enhanced authentication error handling in `AuthContext`

### Performance Monitoring
