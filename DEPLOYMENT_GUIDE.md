# SchoolConnect Deployment Guide

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Code Quality & Security
- [x] Authentication flows hardened with proper redirects
- [x] RLS policies reviewed and optimized
- [x] Error boundaries implemented across critical components
- [x] Race conditions eliminated in auth context
- [x] Dashboard flicker resolved with loading skeletons
- [x] Environment variables properly configured
- [x] No hardcoded secrets in codebase

### ✅ Database Migrations
- [x] `2025-08-18_fix_approval_status.sql` - Approval status data consistency
- [x] `2025-08-18_comprehensive_rls_audit.sql` - Complete RLS policy overhaul

### ✅ Performance Optimizations
- [x] Concurrent profile fetch prevention in AuthContext
- [x] Suspense boundaries for dashboard components
- [x] Loading skeleton components for smooth UX
- [x] Optimized data fetching patterns

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Apply pending migrations
supabase db push

# Verify RLS policies
supabase db diff
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in production:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_APP_ENV=production
```

### 3. Build & Deploy
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm run test
npm run test:e2e

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

#### Authentication Flow
- [ ] Login/logout works correctly
- [ ] Unapproved users see pending approval page
- [ ] Approved users access dashboard
- [ ] Role-based access control functions
- [ ] Session persistence works

#### Dashboard Performance
- [ ] No flicker on initial load
- [ ] Loading skeletons display properly
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and display errors
- [ ] Data fetching is efficient (no duplicate requests)
- [ ] UI remains responsive during loading

#### Database Access
- [ ] RLS policies enforce proper data access
- [ ] Platform admins can manage all data
- [ ] School admins access only their school data
- [ ] Teachers access only their class data
- [ ] No unauthorized data exposure

## Rollback Plan

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous Vercel deployment
vercel rollback

# Or rollback specific commit
git revert <commit-hash>
vercel --prod
```

### Database Rollback
```bash
# Revert migrations if needed
supabase db reset --db-url <production-url>
```

## Monitoring & Health Checks

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Authentication success rate
- Dashboard load times
- Error boundary activation rate
- Database query performance
- RLS policy violations

### Health Check Endpoints
- `/api/health` - Basic app health
- `/api/auth/status` - Authentication service
- `/api/db/status` - Database connectivity

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue: AI Service Timeout
**Symptom**: AI bulletin generation fails with timeout
**Workaround**: Implemented retry logic and rate limiting
**Monitor**: AI service response times

### Issue: Large Dataset Performance
**Symptom**: Slow dashboard loading with many students
**Workaround**: Pagination and lazy loading implemented
**Monitor**: Query execution times

- **Database Issues**: dba@schoolconnect.cd
- **Security Concerns**: security@schoolconnect.cd

## Post-Deployment Tasks

1. **Monitor Error Rates**: Check error boundary logs for 24h
2. **Performance Baseline**: Establish new performance metrics
3. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback on auth flow improvements
4. **Documentation Update**: Update user guides if needed
